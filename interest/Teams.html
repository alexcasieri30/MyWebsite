			</li>

					<tr>
						<td id="team1paragraph">
							The Lakers are my favorite team to watch primarily because of their best player, and the greatest player of all time, Lebron James. They won the NBA championship this past season, and in my opinion, they will repeat as NBA champions next year. They play at an extremely fast pace, and have two of the top 5 players in the league, Lebron James and Anthony Davis. For these reasons, they are extremely fun to watch and are my favorite team to watch in the league.

							My second favorite team to watch is the Golden State Warriors. This is another one of my favorites to watch because of their pace of play. In addition, their two best players Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson aare the two best shooters of all time. When I played basketball, my best attribute was my ability to shoot the ball. Therefore, I can relate to the way that they play, and watching them play makes me want to get out there and play with them.

							My third favorite team is the Chicago Bulls. The Chicago Bulls are absolutely terrible and the only reason why I am putting this team on this list is because I am from Chicago. I have been to countless Bulls games at the United Center in Chicago and I love them every time. I love being able to see professional athletes up close and watch how they prepare themselves for a game every night in a professional manner.

							Lebron James

						<td width="500px">
							Lebron is my favorite player of all time because of his versatility and the way that he can take any group of 5 players and get the best out of all of them. That skill is shown in this highlight video of the 2018 Cleveland Cavaliers.

							Stephen Curry
						</td>
						<td width="500px">
							Stephen Curry is one of my favorite players because of the way he changed the game of basketball. Teams shoot almost double the amount of three pointers per game as they did 30 years ago now, largely because of Stephen Curry. He is also not known for his athleticism and he is only 6'3, so the influence that he has on kids that are not super athletic or tall is immeasurable

							Kobe Bryant
						</td>
						<td width="500px">
							I used to love watching Kobe play. He helped me develop a love for the game of basketball. His competitive spirit and dedication to the game made him one of the best players of all time, and was part of the reason why I am here today. Watching Kobe hit last crazy shots so effortlessly all the time made me want to go practice those shots and get better.

						<td style="font-size: 20pt;">
							Kevin Durant
						</td>
						<td width="500px">
							Kevin Durant is one of my favorite players simply because he is the most skilled, unstoppable player of all time. The game has never seen a 7 foot guard have the skillset and be able to shoot as well as Kevin Durant. It is truly remarkable and I love watching him play.

							Magic Johnson
						</td>
						<td width="500px">
							I never got to see Magic Johnson play basketball live, but I have seen plenty of highlight tapes and know that he is one of the greatest point guards of all time. Similar to Kevin Durant, his skillset at his size is something that has never been seen before in the NBA. He is one of the most unselfish players I have ever seen and definitely one of the greatest passers of all time as well.
